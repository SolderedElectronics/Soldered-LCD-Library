The LCD is in 4 bit mode, meaning each 8 bits of data are sent in two different messages:

RS | RW | E | LED | DATA3 | DATA2 | DATA1 | DATA0
RS | RW | E | LED | DATA7 | DATA6 | DATA5 | DATA4

The LCD_Write function splits a uint8_t (DATA0-7) and sends it like this:

RS | RW | 1 | LED | HighData
RS | RW | 1 | LED | HighData
RS | RW | 0 | LED | HighData
RS | RW | 0 | LED | HighData

except during initialization, then it's sent like this:
RS | RW | 1 | LED | HighData
RS | RW | 1 | LED | HighData


RS: 
RW:
E: is high if it's HighData (bits 7, 6, 5 and 4), low if LowData (3, 2, 1, 0).
LED: Backlight control (1, unless you want to turn off the Backlight)

INITIALIZATION:

0b00000000 is sent to clear I2C

delay(50) after power on
